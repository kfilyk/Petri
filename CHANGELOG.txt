CHANGELOG

1.22:
22/4/17:
- Implemented neuron initialization functions “setOutput”, “setLink”, and “setHidden”, such that “link” neurons perform “input chaining” and are initialized with linear activations, hidden neurons are randomly initialized with weights and a non-linear activation, and output neurons are initialized with zeros for weight values, and a 1 for its linearity value (softsign, static).

- Implemented input “chaining”, where any input value into a network gets passed down 6 layers without modification. This is done using a “linearization” variable L set initially to 0, which lineates the softsign function such that it becomes:

y = x/(1+(L*(abs(x)))

such that when L=0, y=x.

Furthermore, all weight values for any “link” neuron l_i_j, where i is the layer and j is the index, are set to 0- EXCEPT for the weight corresponding to neuron l_(i-1)_j, which is set to 1. Only the 7th layer is initialized with random (normally distributed) weight values, and with a lin value of 1. Neuron activation functions delineate and weight values grow over several generations (successful mutations).

1.21:
18/4/17:
- Fixed scroll issues, so that mouse coordinates align to viewport properly, even with oversized canvas.
- Added moving CARN/HERB, EATR/G/B stats to highlight box.

1.20:
14/4/17:
-fixed regress function, subtract “unsuccessful” changes from rate of change during parent gene mutation rate calculations. Need to further verify technique is really working, but using “PROPAGATE ON” and “REGRESS <1 CHILDREN” seems to have proven fruitful.

1.19:
12/4/17:
- Fixed error in gen graphs where generations are skipped
- Switched to using one weight vector per neuron instead of two… gotta make basics work before experimenting. Doing so reduced dimensionality, made mutations more meaningful, bias more important, reduced flexibility of neurons. Also improved frame-rate.
- In info-card, parameters “ATK” and “CARN/HERB” now represented using +, ++, +++, - , - -, - - -, signifying extremity of decision.
- Tweaked graph buttons (made them larger)
- Tweaked graph names (CPG-> CHILD/GEN; indicates num children each generation had)

1.18:
11/4/17:
- Cleaned up graph buttons
- Fixed HUGE error where input values (already between (-1, 1)) are squashed used softsign function in input layer, resulting in misrepresentation of input information for creatures. Fix resulted in an improved frame rate, improved survival, faster learning rate… etc. Noob mistake.
- regressMode now has 5 modes: m=0 (off), m<4 (children<n), m=4 (cno<4)

1.17:
10/4/17:
- Added “KILL” and “REINCARNATE” functions for creatures, with buttons located at the top of their info cards. A creature must die before they may be reincarnated. A “clone” of the parent creature is created and spawns at the location where the original died.
- Added function where a creature can be picked up and moved, if the creature is highlighted.

1.16:
9/4/17:
- Implemented stat name changes; switching to abbreviations ("FER"=="Food Energy Ratio", "CPG"=="Child Per Gen")
- Discerned variables "genePool" and "liveDesc"- genePool denotes number of descendants contributing to parents' genes, liveDesc refers to number of currently living descendants for that creature.
- Added “resetGenes” and “resetAllGenes” functions. Reset gene mutation rates to 0. “resetAllGenes” is applied to all creatures, when regressMode is changed.

1.15:
7/4/17:
- Added modifiable graph parameters, statistics representing differences among generations.
- Softened regress function to spread mutation changes more accurately. Resulted in higher survival rates for children born to genes which have undergone multiple propagation & regression steps.
- Deleted alpha value

1.13:
3/4/17:
- Improved inheritance of successful gene mutations
- Implemented a balanced algorithm to find mutation rates for child animals by averaging over parents/family successful traits & differences
- Switched object functions to prototype -> saves memory
- Implemented "alpha" variable, used to modify the shape of the softsign function for each neuron

1.09:
26/3/17:
- Back-propagation of unsuccessful mutations ripples through all living petri ancestors
- Fixed bug where borders signaled -100% color, -0 food energy, causing improper decision-making in populations due to this invalid environment parameter relationship
- Implemented forward propagation of successful mutations carried by children to parent

1.07:
24/3/17:
- Cleaned up 1.06 code. No new features. Last version of project using constants as weights, as 1.08 will use multiplicative weights.


1.05:
20/3/17:
Memory input values now fully dependent on memory output value fluctuation.
Sensory input values now fully dependent on sensory output value fluctuation.
Attack input values now fully dependent on attack output value fluctuation.
Memory mutation increments scaled down by factor of 10.
