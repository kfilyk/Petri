# petri
A testing ground for genetic algorithms in a dynamic environment.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1: Click "NEW RANDOM 100" to generate a random set of creatures.
2: Give them about an hour. Petris require some time to deviate from a non-cyclic swimming pattern (rotating only CW/CCW). Over time, noticable changes in behavior become more apparent, however petris will remain slow moving.
